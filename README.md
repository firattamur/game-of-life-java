# Game of Life: Multithreading in Java ⚡️☕

This repository contains an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) designed to learn and practice multithreading and synchronization techniques in Java.

## 🚀 Features

- Basic single-threaded Game of Life implementation
- Grid printing with animated console output
- Opportunities to expand with multithreading and synchronization techniques

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE or use command-line tools.
3. Run the `GameOfLife` class to see the single-threaded implementation in action.
4. Modify or expand the implementation with multithreading and synchronization techniques to explore and practice.

## 🎯 Goals

- Learn and practice multithreading in Java.
- Apply synchronization techniques to solve concurrency issues.
- Understand the Game of Life rules and how they can be translated into code.
- Build a more efficient and optimized implementation using multithreading.
